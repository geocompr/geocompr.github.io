It’s been almost 3 years since the first edition of Geocomputation with R was published back in 2019. It’s been an amazing journey for this open source book on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling since then. We have reached almost 500k people via the website at https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/ and the physical book. The book now contributes to many university courses, lectures, and personal development as outlined at https://geocompr.</description>

      <description>Currently, hundreds of R packages are related to spatial data analysis. They range from ecology and earth observation, hydrology and soil science, to transportation and demography. These packages support various stages of analysis, including data preparation, visualization, modeling, or communicating the results. One common feature of most R spatial packages is that they are built upon some of the main representations of spatial data in R, available in key geographic R packages such as:</description>
