      <title>Conversions between different spatial classes in R</title>

      <description>The R programming language has, over the past two decades, evolved substantial spatial data analysis capabilities, and is now one of the most powerful environments for undertaking geographic research using a reproducible command line interface. Currently, dedicated R packages allow to read spatial data and apply a plethora of different kinds of spatial methods in a reproducible fashion.
There are two main1 spatial data models - spatial vector data and spatial raster data.</description>

      <title>Inset maps with ggplot2</title>

      <description>Inset maps enable multiple places to be shown in the same geographic data visualisation, as described in the Inset maps section (8.2.7) of our open source book Geocomputation with R. The topic of inset maps has gained attention and recently Enrico Spinielli asked inset maps could be created for data in unusual coordinate systems:
Speaking of insets, do you know of any ggplot2 examples with an inset for showing where the (bbox of the) map is in an orthographic/satellite proj?</description>

      <title>Map coloring: the color scale styles available in the tmap package</title>
      <link>https://geocompr.github.io/post/2019/tmap-color-scales/</link>

      <description>This vignette builds on the making maps chapter of the Geocomputation with R book. Its goal is to demonstrate all possible map styles available in the tmap package.
Prerequisites The examples below assume the following packages are attached:
library(spData) # example datasets library(tmap) # map creation library(sf) # spatial data reprojection The world object containing a world map data from Natural Earth and information about countries’ names, regions, and subregions they belong to, areas, life expectancies, and populations.</description>

      <title>Grids and graticules in the tmap package</title>

      <description>This vignette builds on the making maps chapter of the Geocomputation with R book. Its goal is to demonstrate how to set and modify grids and graticules in the tmap package.
Prerequisites The examples below assume the following packages are attached:
library(spData) # example datasets library(tmap) # map creation (&amp;gt;=2.3) library(sf) # spatial data classes  Grids and graticules The tmap package offers two ways to draws coordinate lines - tm_grid() and tm_graticules().</description>

      <title>Geographic projections and transformations</title>
      <link>https://geocompr.github.io/post/2019/crs-projections-transformations/</link>

      <description>Introduction This workbook outlines key concepts and functions related to map projections — also referred to as coordinate reference systems (CRSs) — and transformation of geographic data from one projection to another. It is based on the open source book Geocomputation with R, and Chapter 6 in particular.
It was developed for the ‘CASA Summer School’, or the Doctoral Summer School for Advanced Spatial Modelling: Skills Workshop and Hackathon, 21st to 23rd August 2019, for its full name!</description>
