      <description>Geocomputation with R is a book on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling. Each chapter1 ends with a set of exercises allowing the readers to test how well they understand each presented concepts and approaches. However, exercises are often not enough without their solutions, which provides a way to compare readers’ answers with an expected one. This leads to technical questions: how to provide solutions to the exercises without making the book too long, and to minimise duplication of words/effort (for the questions and answers)?</description>

      <description>Geocomputation with R is a book on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling. The First Edition was first published as a physical book in 2019 and we have reached 500k people through via the website at https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/ and the physical book since then.
The book has also become a key part of many university courses, lectures, and has been endorsed by many people who have found it vital for their work and for learning new geographic skills, as outlined in our guestbook at geocompr.</description>

It’s been almost 3 years since the first edition of Geocomputation with R was published back in 2019. It’s been an amazing journey for this open source book on geographic data analysis, visualization and modeling since then. We have reached almost 500k people via the website at https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/ and the physical book. The book now contributes to many university courses, lectures, and personal development as outlined at https://geocompr.</description>
