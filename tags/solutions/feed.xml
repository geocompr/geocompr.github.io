      <description>Geocomputation with R is a book on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling. Each chapter1 ends with a set of exercises allowing the readers to test how well they understand each presented concepts and approaches. However, exercises are often not enough without their solutions, which provides a way to compare readersâ€™ answers with an expected one. This leads to technical questions: how to provide solutions to the exercises without making the book too long, and to minimise duplication of words/effort (for the questions and answers)?</description>
