- Replacement of `raster` with `terra` in Chapters 1 to 7 (see commits related to this update [here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/search?q=terra&type=commits)) 
- Update of Chapter 8 to include mention alternative ways or reading-in OSM data in [#656](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/pull/656)
- Refactor build settings so the book builds on Docker images in the [geocompr/docker](https://github.com/geocompr/docker) repo
- Improve the experience of using the book in Binder (ideal for trying out the code before installing or updating the necessary R packages), as documented in issue [#691](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/issues/691) (thanks to [yuvipanda](https://github.com/yuvipanda))
- Improved communication of binary spatial predicates in Chapter 4 (see [#675](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/pull/675))
- New section on the links between subsetting and clipping (see [#698](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/pull/698)) in Chapter 5
- New [section](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-operations.html#de-9im-strings) on the dimensionally extended 9 intersection model (DE-9IM)
- New [chapter](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/raster-vector.html) on raster-vector interactions split out from Chapter 5

- s2 mentioned in ch2
- info about "This means that anyone still using these packages should "**transition to sf/stars/terra functions using GDAL and PROJ at your earliest convenience**"."

- Adds section R packages for working with raster data
- terra resampling much improved
- major improvements to Reprojecting geographic data
- many improvements to I/O - more data packages, geocoding part, GeoTIFF COG, read_sf <- st_read; write_sf <- st_write, ogr sql, COG reading
- Recreated several plots using the tmap package
- Improved the Coordinate Reference Systems section - both prose and figures
- Saved some R spatial objects to files in both spData and spDataLarge - this way, we can read data using raster/terra/stars, instead of just loading one package's class object into R memory
- Created external website for solutions
- Updated history
- Customize the look of text blocks
- I would suggest using the authority:code style of specifying CRSs through the book.
- Many small changes...
